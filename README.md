To run this project you have to create 2 file naming ".env", one for client and another one for server.

In client .env file you have paste below code -> 

API_URL=http://localhost:5000

In server .env file you have to paste below code -> 

MONGO_UID = you_have_to_paste_your_mongo_UID
MONGO_PASSWORD = you_have_to_paste_your_mongo_Password
SECRET_KEY = "SECRET VALUE"


For security purpose I haven't write my these thing inside my project.
